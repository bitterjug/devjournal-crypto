# Indigo Data

- [ ] Call Tim Davies <tim@practicalparticipation.co.uk> - Practical participation Wednesday 

- Download some data from the big lottery

- Install RethinkDB http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/ubuntu/

- Run a server

  $ rethinkdb create -d ~/Documents/rethinkdb
  $ rethinkdb -d ~/Documents/rethinkdb &

- Go to the [web interface](http://localhost:8080/#dataexplorer) to make sure its working.

- Create a database in the web interface:

    r.dbCreate('360giving');

- And a table:

    r.db('360giving').tableCreate('BigLottery');

- Let's [load some csv](http://rethinkdb.com/blog/1.7-release/):


Crash and burn:

    $ rethinkdb import -f BIGGrantOpenData2004_05.csv --format csv --table 360giving.BigLottery --force

    [===                                     ]   7%

Not encouraging. `0xa3` [might be the Â£ symbol][1]

I flanged about with python `codecs` library and rewrote the files from
ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) into UTF-8. But in Linux the command line is your friend.

* `file -i`  tells me the current encodings
* `iconv` converts between encodings;

```bash
   iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 BIGGrantOpenData_2005_06.csv -o uBIGGrantOpenData_2005_06.csv
```

Two likely JS libraries on top of d3.js:
* [nvd3](http://nvd3.org/)
* [dimple](http://dimplejs.org/)

* [ ] Convert  (coerce) the `CURRENT_AWARD` field to a real number

``` javascript
     r.table("BigLottery").update({
        amount: r.row("CURRENT_AWARD").coerceTo("Number")
     })  
```

* [ ] Add an index on the `FUNDER NAME`

``` javascript
r.table("BigLottery").indexCreate("FUNDER_NAME")
```

* [ ] Now you can find out how much each funder has given overall

``` javascript
r.table("BigLottery").group({index: "FUNDER_NAME"})('amount').sum() 
```

- [ ]Look into why that last update to add the charity and company numers failed.


    r.db('360giving').table('Organization').update(function (org) {
        return r.do(
            r.db("360giving").table("BigLottery").getAll(org('id'), {index: '360G-id'}).nth(0),
            function (lottery) {
                return {
                   charityNumber: lottery('CHARITY_NUMBER'),
                   companyNumber: lottery('COMPANY_NUMBER')
                };
            }
        );Tech retrospective
    }, {
      nonAtomic: true
    });

- [x] Register bugs with RethinkDB?

  - Can't sort more than 100,000 rows (WTF!?)

  - Inserting dates for each of my 120,000 Big Lottery data rows failed "Have you shut down the server?"

- [ ] Need to Fix Mutt: I think my default archive action, bound to 'a' should use quasi delete.

Bug in v4c.

- Editing activity descriptions results in them having the description from one particular activity.

- Replicated DB locally
- Tried just now on a random activity (4.1.1) and didn't cause replication.
- They have the problem with the Results and Measure ment Output, so I try
  tere.  I edited 10.1.2 which formerly  had a different description and it DID
  change to :

"Inception Meeting with Research Companies (Promundo and TNS) held to discuss expectations and processes "

- This might be coming from the original activity with this id, or from one of the other clones, I guess.

- Did it again and the network tab shows the initiator of the event that caused the update.
- Tracking the stack for this, I found `postChangeElement` in `editable-text.js` is called as soon as I click to start the edit.
But not when I click outside. (on Activity 4.7.1)
- from a breakpoint on `input_view.changeElement` I find that the model recorded for Activity 10.1.1 is Activity #5
- At the `changeElement` stage, we still have the correct object, with the correct description. 
- breakpoint at the start of `input_view.commitEdit`.

Clue!

`$('.savable')` after loading the page gives a non-empty set. it contains the
div for the inception meeting text!  input_view has a handler on `blur` on
`.savable` which I does the update.

-  [ ] v4c: select Indicator descriptions: without editing them, drag up from
   the end of the text and keep the mouse button down and go outside the
   widget, it unselects the text and selectts the table instead. Weird.

Notes for v4c

The hierarchical approach to dates that you propose has some interesting consequences:

- if you expand quarterly "Results" within

The Dfid Yemen component C proposal contains the following statement of Goals:

  The goals of the proposed database system are as follows:

  1. Store qualitative and quantitative datasets from surveys and interviews, and geo-referenced photographs
  2. Searchable by project
  3. Present data on maps
  4. Produce simple reports
  5. Accessible to DFID and project partners

In the context of that programme, this has become a central part of the implied "specification"
of the system. 

I have a problem with this in that it does not in itself provide a sufficiently
guiding vision statement.  I think the problem for me is that it is written in
solution terms and not in business terms. It says what the database will do,
but does not refer to the context in which it will do it, or the business needs
it will be serving. I wonder if we would be in a better place if this were the case. 
I'm thinking of something like:

  * Serve as the canonical storage place for study data for all partners during the programme.
  * Enable DFID and project partners to access study data 
  * Be the platform by which study results are published to DFID and project partners

Hmm. Perhaps not.
