Writing note.sh
=================

[strftime](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/strftime/)
is a C++ function exposed in Vim.

Make the time-stamps sub-headings and format them so they are sortable and then,
in theory at least, I can:

 *  Insert main headings above them to indicate what I'm working on.
 *  Sort by main heading and then sub-heading (if I'm consistent with the main
    headings) to get all the note son one heading.

 *  Bindings for xmonad to invoke
 *  Spent way too long working out how to open and close Voom window.
    finally put it in a vim binding.

Install 13.10, tried:

  * Geary email. Looks cool, Set up for gmail, not as sophisticated
    search (yet) as notmuch
  * Haskell Platofrm finally installs
  * We have tmux 1.8 with support for proper copy and paste
  * Played with conky which is weird because it doesn't seem to have
    a widow border
  * Finally switched back 
  * And, strangely, I seem to have filled half my SSD already, with
    what?

Apparently the upgrade has stopped my `cambridgeenergy.localhost`
working. Visiting that address takes me to the default page for the
server. So the `etc/hosts` entry appears to be still there.  Also,
`/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` and `/etc/apache2/sites-available` both
contain the `cambridgeneergy` configuration file, with the former
being a sym-link to the latter.

## 2014-01-01 12:50 Wednesday

Fixed broken apache2, eventually, by:

1. Change the virtual host config file name to end with .conf
2. Added the following inside the `<VirtualHost>` block to turn
   on access.

    <Directory "">
    Options  All
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
    </Directory>


OSI POINT Iteration 30
=======================

## 2014-01-06 16:14 Monday

  * Prepared sample spreadsheet and sent to client
  * Searching for the code, apprently we use Piston to generte the spreadsheet
    (CSV) which kinda makes sense as its a rendering of data.


## 2014-01-06 16:56 Monday

Looks like the way to proceed is to 

  - modify the list of field names from get_fieldnames in csv_handler.py
    and give names to all the new fields (by apending the tree level to each)

  - Then change the serializer to map the budget fields to their appropriately
    postfixed col names.

## 2014-01-07 10:44 Tuesday

  * Thinking about how to turn a list of column headers from 

        [    ...
            'budget',
            ...
        ]

    into:

        [    ...
            'budget_pfa',
            'budget_so',
            'budget_ma',
            'budget_sa',
            ...
        ]
        
    Found `itertools.chain` which chains iterables together and can be used to
    make a simple shallow version of join/flatten. But it requires all elements
    to be iterable, whereas I want to flatten `['a', 'b', ['c','d'], 'e']`
    into `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`. So  I'm skipping it.



## 2014-01-07 16:44 Tuesday

Working on Filtering by type of planned spending.

  * Follow the example of category_of_work that Daniel did
  * Start by asserting the field appears in the form
  * The get_forward and get_reverse joins methods are about navigating the tree
    from the given start model up to the level where the filtered value is
    stored.
  * Also, see what else Daniel had to touch in order to implement category_of_work filtering.



## 2014-01-08 11:38 Wednesday

  * Daniel's tests look at the generated queries. They don't entail going to
    the database which is probably a good idea. So the test is effectively that
    the correct filter is gerated.  There needs to be another test that this query
    gives the right results too, I guess.

  * Apparently I can get a tf:SomeTreeFilter object and do 

        tf.queries['category_of_work'] 
        
    and it will return a list of ... query stuff. 

## 2014-01-08 17:15 Wednesday

Reproduced Daniel's code, need to merge to dev and staging and deploy. And drop a tag.


## 2014-01-09 15:02 Thursday

Working on Hide unwanted values from drop-down lists.  It turns out that
`BudgetCode` objects already have a link to a set of planning year objects that
determine when they appear. I'm going to re-factor this into a superclass
(at least in the model) and use the same approach for the other values.

Except user might have to be handled differently.

I want to build something like this for ALFIE.



## 2014-01-09 17:45 Thursday

Frioday morning:

- test and deploy fix to OSI live
- Deploy to staging to get server back u

## 2014-01-10 17:57 Friday


Stuck debugging

    Cannot resolve keyword 'budgetcode' into field. Choices are:
    approved_budget, id, locked, money_type, priorityfocusarea, year

in OSI when accessing `BudgetCode.valid_years`. e.g.:

note taking script
===================

## 2014-01-11 20:21 Saturday

What I want this script to do:

  - Each time called add thet ime as a ### heading
  - Firs time called each day, add the date and day name as a ## heading
  - I can still add new # headings with topic

Or maybe:

  - Instead of adding #headings I could add project tags on time lines like
    this:

        ### 21:21 OSI

    To avoid havig to type them much, the script could copy the last
    one each time and maybe put the cursor at that point so it's
    easy to change them?

I want to re-write the shell script as a vim script to do the searching and
replacing.

The vim function should:

  - only work on *markdown* buffers (return if file type is not
    markdown)
  - generate the date string
  - generate the time string
  - check if the date string appears in the buffer
  - if it date string does not already appear in the file, apend
    it (with surrounding blank lines)
  - append the date string with blank lines

Perhaps it should run each time the focus goes in the note buffer
so I can leave it open, but this might end up being annoying.
Probably better to have a global key-binding  that triggers the
command in vim if its open, and if its not open, opens it and
triggers the commend.

Then we need to get the synchronisation working with Git.  In
fact if we sync with Git it might not be necessary to insert the
time stamps because I could use the git log to see the history.



## 2014-01-11 21:40 Saturday

If the new lines are appended using normal commands:
emulating keystrokes, then they can be _undone_ with
'u'?


## 2014-01-11 22:22 Saturday

The script below (`tmp/note.vim`) inserts the time and date stamp.

    " Note
    "

    if exists('Note_loaded')
        delfun Note_add
    endif

    function Note_add()
        let l:datestamp = strftime('%F %A')
        let l:timestamp = strftime('%R')
        let l:lastline = line('$')
        let l:dateheader = ['', '## ' . l:datestamp]
        let l:timeheader = ['', '### ' . l:timestamp, '', '']
        call append(l:lastline, l:timeheader)
        call append(l:lastline, l:dateheader)
    endfunction

    let Note_loaded = 1

Still need to:

 -  make inserting the date conditional (use `search()`)
 -  move the cursor to the end of the file
 -  make sure the text can be removed with 'u'


## 2014-01-12 Sunday

### 14:55 

This version inserts the date only if it isn't already there

``` VimL
    " Note
    "

    if exists('Note_loaded')
        delfun Note_add
    endif

    function Note_add()
        let l:date = '## ' . strftime('%F %A')
        let l:time = '### ' . strftime('%R')
        let l:lastline = line('$')
        call append(l:lastline, ['', l:time, '', ''])
        if !search(date,'w')
            call append(l:lastline, ['', l:date])
        endif
    endfunction

    let Note_loaded = 1
```


## 2014-01-12 20:13 Sunday

Maybe I want to switch to *orgmode* as it supports putting
to-do items in amongst notes, which is a use case I have 
already started using.


## 2014-01-12 21:36 Sunday

Reading about *orgmode*, got distracted refactoring my vimrc 
so multiple `autocmds` become one with a call to a function.
See the benefit of learning vimscript finally?

## 2014-01-12 23:38 Sunday

I don't like the way orgmode presents embedded code, markdown just lets me
indent it. But it has the option to collect TODOs from all over the place and
present them, which might be useful.  It's date stamp stuff is really for
preparing future dated todos. Which is a bit esoteric. More likely a list of
todos for a given project. An if Im using time stamping to journal progress,
going back and checking todos from earlier might seem strange. I can see how it
might work though where you just add a todo when you're thinking about
something. And then get the whole list using the plugin commands. And 
work through them. I've not been very good at working through todos
since switching to GTG.

## 2014-01-15 14:48 Wednesday

Oracle java 8 installed, still cant open dialogue boxes in freemind.
Maybe it needs an earlier version, or maybe Oracle broke it.

Moved search box to top menu but don't know how to position
it aligned with the menu items. For some reason it shows up
as aligned with the top of the page, not down to the bottom 
of its containing div. CSS is such a drag.

IT might be possible to just remove it from the template
and put it back with some sort of widget config?

can do it on our company docs account, we should be able to pull from
a calendar shred by the devs?)

### V4C Kick-off meeting

Can we do:

 - Site-map/user story/workflow plan for site with Ellie?
 - SSO with Sharepoint should be treated as a lower priority.
 - what is relationshiup with ALFIE code base and V4c?
 - What needs to be on a card for it to become a candidate?
    - What should it look like (visual design)
    - How should it behave
    - the whole journey
    - Definition of Done (it's done when you can do the following things
      with the system.) outline of steps to test manually
    - Every feature that has to be in the story should be listed before we
      start working on it.
        - If there are mock-up images, are they "the spririt" or the exact
          look of the things we have to build?
        - A list of features that have to be there, if not directly
          implied by the mock-ups.
        - Anything that is not included is not part of the story (c.f.
          story of boolean logical search, which entailed definition of a
          grammar for the search language)
    - technical approach
        - e.g save 'Outputs' they are several levels deep nested formsets
          vs e.g.  backbone
        - Both are 'unknown' to some degree
        - Don't feel comfortable enough to estimate
        - JAvascript approach don't just bung js files in a directory and
          link to them.
        - Set up front-end environment, e.g. Grunt/Require.js, etc.
        - Need javascript tests, need automatic running/ build server

 - when can we estimate cards (what to they need)

 - [ ] Marko to get met a sample of good card details/spec to look at from
   3ie

 - [x] MCS invite Elly and Marko to UML tool 
 - [ ] Talk Elly and Marko through data model 
 - [ ] SparkleShare for Elly (or Dropbox, ...?)


## 2014-01-20 14:53 Monday

Possible insight on sub-indicator: corresponds to rows in the tool Is it the
atomic level at which you measure, so that later measurements in that row
replace/override earlier ones. As opposed to being added together.


## 2014-01-20 16:19 Monday

Ask George:

- [ ] Is achievement of outputs one of the indicators for outcomes?
- [ ] There can be only one Goal, ok, but what about more than one outcome?


## 2014-01-24 15:04 Friday

A theory about sub-indicators.
 Sub-indicators:
        - are non-overalpping category spaces 
        - where later measurements replace earlier ones
